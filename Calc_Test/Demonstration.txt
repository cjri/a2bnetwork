The Calc_Test directory contains files allowing for a test run of the code.  Files are as follows:

Pat_file_test.csv : Contains basic information describing cases of infection, including IDs, sequence names, and dates of onset and sample collection.
Test_sets.fa : Contains genome sequences corresponding to the individuals in Pat_file_test.
ward_movement_test.csv : Contains patient movement data, describing which individuals were on certain wards in the hospital and on which dates
hcw_movement_test.csv : Contains HCW movement data, describing the locations of wards on which indiviudals worked shifts

Calculations may be run in a series of steps:

Step 1:

../NewEpiCode/run_basic --pat_file Pat_file_test.csv --ali_file Test_seqs.fa --ward_file ward_movement_test.csv --mov_file hcw_movement_test.csv --calculation 1 > Run1.out

This calculation identifies a list of plausible transmission networks connecting the individuals.  The output files are: 

Checkpoint1.out: This contains information for the read in of checkpointing information

Check1_0_0.out: This contains the checkpoint information describing the plausible networks.  Briefly the numbers describe potential transmission events, constraints on their timings, and information describing constraints in the ordering of these events.

Run1.out: This contains various output from the code.  Examining the output it is possible to find a list of plausible transmission networks, listed beginning with the following lines:

Individuals
0 1 2 3 4 5
0 5 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 0-5,
0 5 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 1-5,
0 5 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 2-5,

Here, the first network is one in which individual 0 infects all of the individuals {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Step 2:

../NewEpiCode/run_basic --pat_file Pat_file_test.csv --ali_file Test_seqs.fa --ward_file ward_movement_test.csv --mov_file hcw_movement_test.csv --calculation 2 > Run2.out

This calculation identifies the plausible orderings in which the events in each transmission network can occur.  The outputs are:

Check2_0_0.out: This contains checkpoint information describing the plausible networks and their orderings.  A numerical code is used to designate orderings of transmission events.

Run2.out: This contains various output from the code.

Step 3:

../NewEpiCode/run_basic --pat_file Pat_file_test.csv --ali_file Test_seqs.fa --ward_file ward_movement_test.csv --mov_file hcw_movement_test.csv --calculation 3 > Run3.out

This calculates likelihoods for all of the plausible ordered networks.  The likelihood provided is the sum of the likelihoods for each order of a network.  The outputs are:

Likelihoods_0_0.out: Contains a list of the likelihoods for each of the networks.  Each network is given an index, followed by a description of the transmission in the network; here A-B indicates that A infected B.

Run3.out: This contains various output from the code.

../NewEpiCode/run_basic --pat_file Pat_file_test.csv --ali_file Test_seqs.fa --ward_file ward_movement_test.csv --mov_file hcw_movement_test.csv --calculation 4 --likelihood_file Likelihoods_0_0
ut > Run4.out

This compiles the likelihoods into a set of edge occupancies.  These are calculated using the likelihoods calculated for each of the networks described in Likelihoods_0_0.out.  The outputs are:

Edge_occupancies.out: This contains a matrix of numbers, describing the statistical proportion of networks containing each transmission event.  For example, the value at {0,1} describes the proportion of networks which involve transmission from individual 0 to individual 1.

Run4.out: Contains various output from the code.


-----Further notes-----

The above calculations run a complete calculation and are designed for a case where this can be done quickly.  In some cases, the likelihood calculation can be computationally costly to perform.  A variety of options and routines allow for this.

Alternative Step 3:

../NewEpiCode/run_basic --pat_file Pat_file_test.csv --ali_file Test_seqs.fa --ward_file ward_movement_test.csv --mov_file hcw_movement_test.csv --calculation 3 --c_start x --c_step y  > Run3.out

This calculates likelihoods for every yth network in the list provided by the checkpoint file from --calculation 2, beginning at network x.

Further calculations that are possible with this code are described in the Instructions.txt.  However, the above set of routines provides a complete analysis of a network for which heavy computation is nr required.
